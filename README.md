# SimpleITK Exercise

This assignment includes five functions that you would have to modify, so that you can learn how:

* many files from a folder can be read for their image content.
* how SimpleITK is used to load these image files.
* how to register images from various modalities using library functions.
* run a SimpleITK filter on image data - to rescale the pixel contents.
* run a median filtering operation using library functions.

Each of these functions are then tested for correctness, and you will be awarded 1 point for each passing test. 

All the best!
